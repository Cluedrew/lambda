# lambda
A simple lambda calculator for working with lambda calculus.

This project was created because I like lambda calculus and I wanted to do
some work with my own languages, but a 'true' programming language is far
beyond me and the time I have right now.

### Currant Goal ###

Currantly I am trying to convert the barely working code* into a more
structured language definition so it is both more robust and easier to
expand appon in the future.

* I broke it during the conversion.

### Note ###
This does not currantly mimic true lambda calculus, I have taken some short
cuts to get it off the ground. Read lambda.txt to see the definitions I am
using for this project.

The project as a whole is currently highly unstable as I get it to the first
"complete" verison.
