# lambda
A simple lambda calculator for working with lambda calculus.

This project was created because I like lambda calculus and I wanted to do
some work with my own

### Note ###
This does not currantly mimic true lambda calculus, I have taken some short
cuts to get it off the ground. Read lambda.txt to see the definitions I am
using for this project.
